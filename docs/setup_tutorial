Setup:
File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> tarkvara-lab2 -> Dependencies -> "+" sign -> Library... -> Select junit and hamcrest libraries found in the project and click "Add Selected"

To run all tests, right click the test folder in project filetree and click "Run 'All Tests' with Coverage".
A Coverage window should appear on the right side of the editor (if not, go to Analyze -> Show Code Coverage Data -> select desired coverage results if prompted)

NOTE: if the option "Run 'All Tests' with Coverage" is greyed out or you are having errors in the project, check:
	File -> Settings... -> Plugins -> make sure you have Coverage and JUnit plugins enabled (maybe in your case you have to enable something else aswell)
