Setup:

* Run Intellij client and Open the folder "code".
* Check whether necessary libraries are added:
	- go to File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> tarkvara-lab2 -> Dependencies
	- check whether hamcrest and junit libraries are in there
		* if not "+" sign -> Library... -> Select junit and hamcrest libraries found in the project under folder "lib" and click "Add Selected"

To run all tests, right click the test folder in project filetree and click "Run 'All Tests' with Coverage". If there is no such option or it is greyed out, look at Prob-1 section below. A Coverage window with results should appear on the right side of the editor (if not, go to Analyze -> Show Code Coverage Data -> select desired coverage results in case prompted).

Prob-1: The option "Run 'All Tests' with Coverage" is greyed out / not present or you are having errors in the project. 
	Check:
		File -> Settings... -> Plugins -> Installed -> make sure you have Coverage and JUnit plugins enabled (maybe in your case you have to enable something else aswell (maybe Intellij has already prompted you about it)).
